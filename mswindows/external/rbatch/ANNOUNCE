
batchfiles is a set of batch, javascript and HTML
Application files that are useful for running R and
associated programs.

Version 0.6-0 updates them for the new architecture
specific directory structure in R 2.12.0 .

A few of the lesser used utilities have been dropped.

Each batchfile is self contained.  To install just
place all or just any that you wish to use anywhere on
your path.  The batch command:

	path

will show you which folders are on your path.


DOWNLOAD

They can be downloaded individually from the svn
repository available via the home page or they can be
downloaded all at one in a zip file from CRAN here:
