Displays text using TrueType fonts.
===================================

To use this module, install FreeType2 first.


configure tries to find ft2build.h and this file includes
.../freetype2/freetype/config/ftheader.h.  In my case, ft2build.h is located
in /usr/local/include and other freetype header files are in
/usr/local/include/freetype2.
  

BUGS
====
With some PCF files, it cannot handle bitmap images correctly.
Could anyone fix this?
