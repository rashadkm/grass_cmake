<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.compress</em> can be used to compress and decompress
raster map layers. Additionally, it prints information about the
compression method and data type of the input raster map(s).

<p>
During (re-)compression, <em>r.compress</em> compresses raster maps 
using the method spcified with the environment variable 
<b>GRASS_COMPRESSOR</b>. The feault is  ZLIB's "deflate" (LZ77-based) 
algorithm. Raster map layers which contain very little information 
(such as boundary, geology, soils and land use maps) can be greatly 
reduced in size. Some raster map layers are shrunk to roughly 1% of 
their original sizes. All newly generated raster maps are automatically 
stored in compressed form (see FORMATS below). All GRASS modules can 
read both compressed and uncompressed file formats.

<p>
As an example, the Spearfish data base raster map layer
<em>owner</em> was originally a size of 26600 bytes.  After
it was RLE compressed, the raster map became only 1249 bytes
(25351 bytes smaller).

<p>
Raster maps that are already compressed are again compressed. This is 
useful if either the compression method set with the environment 
variable <b>GRASS_COMPRESSOR</b> (RLE, ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2) is changed or 
if the ZLIB compression level is manually changed by setting the 
environment variable GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL.

<p>
Raster files may be decompressed manually to return them to their 
original format, using the <b>-u</b> flag of <em>r.compress</em>. If a 
raster map is already decompressed, it simply informs the user the map 
is already decompressed and exits.


<h3>TERMINOLOGY</h3>

<ul>
<li> INTEGER map (CELL data type): a raster map from INTEGER type (whole
  numbers only)</li>
<li> FLOAT map (FCELL data type): a raster map from FLOAT type (4 bytes,
  7-9 digits precision)</li>
<li> DOUBLE map (DCELL data type): a raster map from DOUBLE type (8 bytes,
  15-17 digits precision)</li>
<li> NULL: represents "no data" in raster maps, to be distinguished from
  0 (zero) data value</li>
</ul>

<h3>USED COMPRESSION ALGORITHMS</h3>

Floating point (FCELL, DCELL) raster maps never use RLE compression;
they are either compressed with ZLIB, LZ4, BZIP2 or are uncompressed.
<p>
Raster maps are by default ZLIB compressed. If the environment variable 
<tt>GRASS_INT_ZLIB</tt> exists and has the value 0, newly generated 
compressed integer (CELL type) raster maps will be compressed using RLE 
compression instead of ZLIB.
<p>
In the internal cellhd file, the value for "compressed" is 1 for RLE, 2 
for ZLIB, 3 for LZ4, and 4 for BZIP2.
<p>
Obviously, decompression is controlled by the raster map's compression,
not the environment variable.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>r.compress</em> can be run either non-interactively or
interactively.  In non-interactive use, the user must
specify the name(s) of the raster map layer(s) to be
compressed (or decompressed) on the command line, using the
form <b>map=</b><em>name</em>[,<em>name</em>,...] (where
each <em>name</em> is the name of a raster map layer to be
compressed or decompressed). The default behavior is to 
compress the named map(s).  

<h3>FORMATS</h3>

Conceptually, a raster data file consists of rows of cells, with each 
row containing the same number of cells. A cell consists of one or more 
bytes. For CELL maps, the number of bytes per cell depends on the 
category values stored in the cell. Category values in the range 0-255 
require 1 byte per cell, while category values in the range 256-65535 
require 2 bytes, and category values in the range above 65535 require 3 
(or more) bytes per cell.
<p>
FCELL maps always have 4 bytes per cell and DCELL maps have always 8 
bytes per cell.

<p>
Since GRASS GIS 7.0.0, the default compression method for 
Integer (CELL) maps is ZLIB and not any more the RLE compression.

<h4>ZLIB compression level</h4>

If the environment variable <tt>GRASS_ZLIB_LEVEL</tt> exists and
its value can be parsed as an integer, it determines the compression
level used when newly generated raster maps are compressed using zlib
compression. This applies to all raster map types (CELL, FCELL, DCELL).
<p>
If the variable does not exist, or the value cannot be parsed as an
integer, zlib's default compression level will be used.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Printing of current compression state:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.compress compressed_no -p
  &lt;compressed_no&gt; (method 0: NONE). Data type: &lt;CELL&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
Applying RLE compression to a copy of the uncompressed map:
<div class="code"><pre>
# compression of map using RLE compression
g.copy raster=compressed_no,compressed_RLE

export GRASS_INT_ZLIB=0 # RLE
r.compress compressed_RLE 
r.compress compressed_RLE -p 
  &lt;compressed_RLE&gt; is compressed (method 1: RLE). Data type: &lt;CELL&gt;
unset GRASS_INT_ZLIB
</pre></div>

<p>
Applying ZLIB compression to a copy of the uncompressed map:
<div class="code"><pre>
# compression of map using ZLIB compression
g.copy raster=compressed_no,compressed_ZLIB

export GRASS_INT_ZLIB=1 # ZLIB
r.compress compressed_ZLIB
r.compress compressed_ZLIB -p
  &lt;compressed_ZLIB&gt; is compressed (method 2: ZLIB). Data type: &lt;CELL&gt;
unset GRASS_INT_ZLIB
</pre></div>

<p>
Applying BZIP2 compression to a copy of the ZLIB-compressed map:
<div class="code"><pre>
# compression of map using BZIP2 compression
g.copy raster=compressed_ZLIB,compressed_BZIP2

export GRASS_COMPRESSOR=BZIP2 # BZIP2
r.compress compressed_BZIP2
r.compress compressed_BZIP2 -p
  &lt;compressed_BZIP2&gt; is compressed (method 4: BZIP2). Data type: &lt;CELL&gt;
unset GRASS_COMPRESSOR
</pre></div>
