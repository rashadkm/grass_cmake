r.out.bin

This program is derived from r.out.ascii with a few modifications.

If exported data is moved between platforms byte swapping 
may be required.

The exported data can be converted to netCDF GMT format with 
xyz2grd .... -ZTLf -F

TODO:
- Add optional fixed size header (1024) with region specs.
- Add byte swapping export routine.

--------------------
The source for r.out.bin which writes a binary array to            
standard output. The source is taken from r.out.ascii with a few minor          
changes. Depending on the data type the program will output a integer,          
float, or double array, unless "-i" is specified, then it will be forced        
to integer. The region parameters are printed to stderr. This file is           
compatible with the generic mapping tools (GMT) program xyz2grd if the          
user wants to convert to netCDF. I have also been re-writing r.in.bin to        
be more flexible for this type of data and allow float import. I will           
pass this code along when I am happy with it. I noticed it has none of          
the new Grass-5 lib routines.
