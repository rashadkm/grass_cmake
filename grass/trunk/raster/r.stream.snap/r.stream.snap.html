<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The module <em>r.stream.snap</em> is a supplementary module for
<em><a href="r.stream.extract.html">r.stream.extract</a></em> and
<em><a href="r.stream.basins.html">r.stream.basins</a></em> to correct
position of outlets or stream initial points as they do not lie on the
streamlines.

<p>
For outlets, the situation is clear. Points are snapped to nearest
point which lies on the streamline. In situation where there can be a
small tributuary nearer than main stream accumulation threshold shall
be high enough to force the program ignoring this tributuary and snap
to the main stream. If there is no accumulation map, the points will
be snapped to the nearest stream line, which in particular situations
may be wrong. Because the <em>r.stream.*</em> modules are prepared to
work with MFD accumulation maps, both stream network and accumulation
map are neccessary to resolve the problem.

<p>
While it is assumed that the accumulation map is a MFD map, if the
stream network is not supplied, the snap point is calculated in
different way: the threshold is used to select only these points in
search radius which have accumulation value greater than the given
threshold.  The next mean value of these points is calculated and its
value is taken as a new threshold. This procedure guarantees that
points are snapped to the center of stream tube. While for inits small
thresholds are in use, it is probable that points were snapped to the
streamtube border instead of its center.

<p>
It is strongly recommended to use both stream network (even
pre-generated with small accumulation threshold) and accumulation
raster map, than accumulation or stream raster map only.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>stream_rast</b></dt>
<dd>Stream network created
by <em><a href="r.stream.extract.html">r.stream.extract</a></em> or
<em><a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a></em>. If used, the
points are snapped to the nearest streamline point whose accumulation
is greater than threshold. If the accumulation is not used, the point
is snapped to the nearest stream.
</dd>

<dt><b>accumulation</b></dt>
<dd>Accumulation map created
with <em><a href="r.watershed.html">r.watershed</a></em> and used to
generate the stream network
with <em><a href="r.stream.extract.html">r.stream.extract</a></em>. If
the stream network is not used, the point is adaptively snapped to the
point where the value is greater than mean values of accumulation
greater than given threshold in a search radius. See description for
details.
</dd>
<dt><b>radius</b></dt>
<dd>Search radius (in cells). If there are no streams in the search
radius, the point is not snapped. If there are no cells with
accumulation greater than accumulation threshold, the point also is
not snapped.
</dd>

<dt><b>threshold</b></dt>
<dd>Minimum value of accumulation which cell must have to snap
point. This option is added to snap stream inits to the stream tubes
and to distinguish between local tributaries and main streams.
</dd>

<dt><b>input</b></dt>
<dd>Vector file containing outlets or inits as vector points. Only
point's categories are used. Any table attached to it is
ignored. Every point shall have his own unique category.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>OUTPUTS</h3>

<p>Vector file containing outlets or inits after snapping. On layer 1,
the original categories are preserved, on layer 2 there are four
categories which mean:
<ol>
<li>skipped (not in use yet)
<li>unresolved (points remain unsnapped due to lack of streams in search radius
<li>snapped (points snapped to streamlines)
<li>correct (points which remain on their original position, which were
originally corrected)
</ol>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region -p -a rast=elevation
r.watershed elevation=elevation threshold=10000 drainage=dirs stream=streams accumulation=accum
# snap a point sampled in the riverine landscape to the calculated river network
r.stream.snap input=mysampleoutlet output=mysampleoutlet_snapped stream_rast=streams accumulation=accum
</pre></div>
