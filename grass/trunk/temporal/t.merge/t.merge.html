<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This module is designed to register the maps of several input space time datasets in a single output dataset.
The datasets to merge can be either space time raster, 3D raster or vector datasets and must
have the same temporal type (absolute or relative).
<p>
Existing space time datasets located in the current mapset can be specified as output as well. The
maps from the input space time datasets will be added to the output.
<p>
Maps from the input space time datasets will be registered only once in the 
output space time dataset, hence the same maps can be registered in different input space time datasets.
