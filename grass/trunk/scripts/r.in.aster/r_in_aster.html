<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r_in_aster.py</EM> uses GDALWARP and r.in.gdal to read, georectify, reproject, and import into GRASS Terra/ASTER imagery in HDF4 format. It will import Level 1A, Level 1B, and DEM imagery.
<P>
The user selects the *.hdf file to import, the type of imagery (Level 1B is the default), the bands to import, and the base name of the output file. Single or multiple bands can be imported by entering the band number or numbers separated by commas (1,2,3n,3b,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14) in the input field. All bands can be imported by entering 'all' in the input field. The band number will be appended to the output file base name ('.DEM' will be appended to DEM files).
<P>
GDALWARP will attempt to reproject the Terra/ASTER imagery into the current location. For some Terra/ASTER files this may be unsuccesful. There will be an error message to that effect. The user will need to start GRASS in a location that matches the Terra/ASTER imagery--possibly a latlon location.

<H2>GDAL GDALWARP REQUIREMENT</H2>

em>r.in.aster</em> requires <A HREF="http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html">GDALWARP</a> (one of the Geographic Data Abstraction Library [GDAL] utilities) to be installed and to be in the user's path. GDAL must be compiled with HDF4 support.
