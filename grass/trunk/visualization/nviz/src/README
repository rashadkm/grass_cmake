HOWTO - Adding new header files from tcl/tk:

Problem: The header files tkInt.h and tkIntDecls.h differ between
         the various TK library versions. If not updated, NVIZ
         will just crash (or doesn't compile at all).

Solution: We have to add the individual header files (tkInt.h and
          tkIntDecls.h) from the tk source code. For that
          they are renamed according to their version number.
          The togl.c contains a set of 'if' + 'elif' to reflect
          the various version numbers.

Step-by-step:

1. download from http://tcl.sourceforge.net and add here (rename!)
   tkInt.h      -> tkInt8.x.h (e.g. tkInt8.4.h)
   tkIntDecls.h -> tkIntDecls8.x.h (e.g. tkIntDecls8.x.h)

2. change in tkInt8.x.h the include statement to tkIntDecls8.x.h

3. edit togl.c
   add 'elif' statement with new names according to version
   of TK

4. complain about these stupid things to Tcl/Tk developers
