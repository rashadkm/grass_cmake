<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>i.evapo.PT</EM> Calculates the diurnal evapotranspiration after Prestley and Taylor (1972). 
The Priestley-Taylor model (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) is a modification of Penmanâ€™s more theoretical equation.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
RNETD optional output from i.evapo.potrad is giving good results as input for net radiation in this module.

Alpha values:
1.32 for estimates from vegetated areas as a result of the increase in surface roughness (Morton, 1983; Brutsaert and Stricker, 1979)
1.26 is applicable in humid climates (De Bruin and Keijman, 1979; Stewart and Rouse, 1976; Shuttleworth and Calder, 1979), and temperate hardwood swamps (Munro, 1979)
1.74 has been recommended for estimating potential evapotranspiration in more arid regions (ASCE, 1990). This Worked well in Greece with University of Thessaloniki.
