<EM>i.qc.modis</EM> Extracts Requested Quality Assessment flags from Modis 09 A and Q products.

<EM>MODLAND QA Bits 250m/500m bits[0-1]</EM>
[00]= class 1: Corrected product produced at ideal quality -- all bands
[01]= class 2: Corrected product produced at less than idel quality -- some or all bands
[10]= class 3: Corrected product NOT produced due to cloud effect -- all bands
[11]= class 4: Corrected product NOT produced due to other reasons -- some or all bands maybe be fill value (Note that a value of [11] overrides a value of [01])

<EM> Cloud State 250m Unsigned Int bits[2-3] </EM>
[00]= class 1: Clear -- No clouds
[01]= class 2: Cloudy
[10]= class 3: Mixed
[11]= class 4: Not Set ; Assumed Clear

<EM> Band-wise Data Quality 250m Unsigned Int bits[4-7][8-11]</EM>
<EM> Band-wise Data Quality 500m long Int bits[2-5][6-9][10-13][14-17][18-21][22-25][26-29]</EM>
[0000]= class 1: highest quality
[0111]= class 2: noisy detector
[1000]= class 3: dead detector; data interpolated in L1B
[1001]= class 4: solar zenith ge 86 degrees
[1010]= class 5: solar zenith ge 85 and lt 86 degrees
[1011]= class 6: missing input
[1100] class 7: internal constant used in place of climatological data for at least one atmospheric constant
[1101]= class 8: correction out of bounds, pixel constrained to extreme allowable value
[1110]= class 9: L1B data faulty
[1111]= class 10: not processed due to deep ocean or cloud
Class 11: Combination of bits unused

<EM>Atmospheric correction 250m/500m bit[12]/[30]</EM>
[00]= class 1: Not Corrected product
[01]= class 2: Corrected product

<EM>Adjacency correction 250m/500m bit[13][31]</EM>
[00]= class 1: Not Corrected product
[01]= class 2: Corrected product

<EM>Different orbit from 500m product, 250m Unsigned Int bit[14]</EM>
[00]= class 1: same orbit as 500m
[01]= class 2: different orbit from 500m
