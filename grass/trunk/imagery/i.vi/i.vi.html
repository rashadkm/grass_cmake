<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>i.vi</EM> calculates vegetation indices based on biophysical parameters. 

1. RVI: ratio vegetation index: 
2. NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
3: IPVI: Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index
4: DVI: Difference Vegetation Index
5: PVI: Perpendicular Vegetation Index
6: WDVI: Weighted Difference Vegetation Index
7: SAVI: Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index 
8: GARI: Green atmospherically resistant vegetation index
9: MSAVI: Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
10:MSAVI2: second Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
11:GEMI: Global Environmental Monitoring Index
12:ARVI: atmospherically resistant vegetation indices
13:GVI: Green Vegetation Index

NDVI 
Data Type Band Numbers ([IR, Red]) 
TM Bands= [4,3] 
MSS Bands = [7, 5] 
AVHRR Bands = [2, 1] 
SPOT XS Bands = [3, 2] 
AVIRIS Bands = [51, 29] 


(AVHRR) NDVI = (channel 2 - channel 1) / (channel 2 + channel 1)
