BUGS:
 * The modules (still) crashes if the the WIND3 region differs from
  the volume coordinates (region settings which where used when
  the volume was generated).

 * Probably the output is flipped north/south??

 * if 100 rows/cols/depth are there, only 99 rows/cols/depth will
   be exported to Vis5D: problem of center cell and corner cell

G3D library bug?
        G3d_getValueRegion (map, x, y, z, d1p, typeIntern);                  
     produces output with different orientation comparing to:
        G3d_getValue(map, x, y, z, d1p, typeIntern);
