Comment:

      There seems to be no error checking in the original r.timestamp, so I
 haven't bothered to put error checking into r3.timestamp.  Both commands
 produce a timestamp file that's only 1 byte long if the user enters an
 incorrectly formatted date/time, and both commands fail to inform the user
 that anything is wrong.  The user finds out soon enough when he or she
 tries reading the timestamp and gets the following result:

 GRASS 5.0beta9 > r.timestamp bathym
 WARNING: Invalid timestamp file for raster map bathym in mapset pelizzar

 Perhaps the timestamp commands should issue warnings if they fail to
 complete their tasks successfully, so the user will know immediately if
 their outputs are invalid.
