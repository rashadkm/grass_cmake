Introduction
============

wxGUI toolboxes enables GUI customization and organization of menu (and other views) according to user needs.

XML files are used for code generation and in case of toolboxes enables wxGUI (menu) customization.

Currently, all the files described here are related to the menus which are generated from these files. The most of the files described here are the part of implementation of toolboxes in wxGUI.

Each XML file has a DTD file which can by used for validation. XSD files are not provided (but this can change in the future). Some file types can occur multiple times, some occur only once.

Note that in XML context, the term
*tag*
partially overlaps with the term
*element*
. Element emphasizes the XML structure, XML object model and content of these objects. Tag emphasizes the markup and the name of the element.
