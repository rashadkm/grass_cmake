<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.build</em> builds support files for GRASS vector maps. These
support files supply topology and category information including
spatial index that are needed by other GRASS modules.

<p>
GRASS is generating these support files automatically, only in rare
cases the user has to (re)build them.

<p>
Refer to
<a href="vectorintro.html">vector data processing in GRASS GIS</a> for
more information on GRASS vector data model.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>v.build</em> creates support files only for vector maps located in
the user's current mapset. It's not possible to rebuild support files
(<b>option=build</b>) for vector maps from other mapsets.

<p>
In case of errors, the user can optionally generate an <b>error</b>
vector map containing the erroneous vectors for later inspection.
