<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.extrude</em> creates faces, kernels or 3D lines based on 2D
vector features. Points are converted to 3D vertical lines, boundaries
to faces and areas to volumes (composition of faces and kernel).

<p>
If the flag <b>-t</b> and <b>elevation</b> parameter is used then 3D
vector features follow the elevation model by using individual
elevation values for the vertices and nodes. Height is interpolated
from elevation model using given interpolation <b>method</b>. This can
be useful for models of large objects (eg. forest stands).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>v.extrude</em> extrudes vector features which means that points
are converted to vertical lines. Lines are not supported by this
module.

<p>
For conversion of 2D points or lines to 3D can be also
used <em><a href="v.to.3d.html">v.to.3d</a></em>. In opposite
to <em>v.extrude</em>, <em><a href="v.to.3d.html">v.to.3d</a></em>
doesn't extrude vector features, it just defines z-coordinate for the
feature geometry. It means that no feature type conversion is applied,
points remains still points. Same applies for the lines.

<p>
<em>v.extrude</em> modifies only features geometry, attribute data
remain untouched.

<p>
By default, all features (including features without category) from
input vector map are processed (<b>layer=-1</b>). Feature selection
can be applied by <b>layer</b>, <b>cats</b> or <b>where</b>
parameter.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>3D houses with fixed height</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.extrude input=houses output=houses3D height=5 type=area
</pre></div>

<h3>3D houses with individual height</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.extrude input=houses output=houses3D elevation=dem hcolumn=height type=area
</pre></div>

<h3>Convert 2D points to 3D vertical lines with fixed height</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.extrude input=geodetic_pts output=points3D height=200 type=point
</pre></div>
