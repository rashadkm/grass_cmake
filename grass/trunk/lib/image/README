This library must be compiled before compiling SG3d/NVIZ2.2

--------------------------------------------------
This source code comes from Paul Haeberli at SGI.
It is distributed with all SGI computers in 
/usr/people/4Dgifts/iristools/libimage.
We include it here as a convenience to GRASS users.

This library allows SG3d to save images from the graphics window 
in .rgb files, the IRIS image format.

See also:
