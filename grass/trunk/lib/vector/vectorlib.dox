\section vlibBackground Background

Generally, the vector data model is used to describe geographic
phenomena which may be represented by geometric entities like
<em>points</em>, <em>lines</em>, and <em>areas</em>. The GRASS vector
data model includes the description of <em>topology</em>, where
besides the coordinates describing the location of the primitives
(points, lines, boundaries, centroids, faces, kernels, and volumes),
their spatial relations are also stored. In general, topological GIS
requires a data structure where the common boundary between two
adjacent areas is stored as a single line, simplifying the vector data
maintenance.


\section vlibIntro Introduction

The GRASS 6/7 vector format is very similar to the previous GRASS 4.x
(5.0/5.3) vector format.

This description covers the new GRASS 6/7 vector library architecture.
This new architecture overcomes the vector limitations of GRASS
4.x-5.4.x by extending the vector support with attributes stored in
the external relational databases, and by new 3D capabilities. Besides
internal file based storage the geometry may alternatively be stored
in a PostGIS database (accessible via OGR interface). This enables
users to maintain large data sets with simultaneous write
access. External GIS formats such as SHAPE-files may be used directly,
without requiring format conversion. All vector data accessed through 
the OGR interface have only pseudo-topology and only a limited subset 
of vector operations can be performed.

The current implementation includes:   

- <em>multi-layer</em>: features in one vector map may represent more
    layers and may be linked to more external tables (see \ref
    vlibCategoriesLayers)
- <em>2D and 3D vector geometry</em> with full topology support for 2D and
  partial topology support for 3D (see \ref vlibTopoManagement)
- <em>multi-format</em>: external data formats supported (SHAPE-file,
  OGR sources etc.)
- <em>portability</em>: platform independent internal format, read- and
      writable on 32bit, 64bit etc. computer architectures
- integrated \ref dglib - support for vector network analysis
- <em>spatial index</em>: based on R-tree method for fast vector
  geometry access (see \ref vlibSpidx)
- <em>multi-attribute</em>: attributes saved in external Relational
      Database Management System (RDBMS) connected through DBMI
      library and drivers (see \ref vlibAttributes)

\section vlibVectorMap Vector map definition (native format)

GRASS vector maps are stored in an <em>arc-node</em> representation,
consisting of curves called arcs. An arc is stored as a series of
x,y,z coordinate pairs. The two endpoints of an arc are called
<em>nodes</em>. Two consecutive x,y,z pairs define an arc segment. The
user specifies the type of input to GRASS; GRASS doesn't decide. GRASS
supports feature type definition which allows for multiple types to
co-exist in the same map. A centroid is assigned to the area it is
within/inside (geometrically). An area is defined by one or more 
boundaries that form a losed ring. The category to which an area belongs 
is stored with the centroid. Such centroids are stored in the same binary
'coor' file with other primitives. Each element may have none, one or
more categories (cats). More cats can be distinguished by field number
(field, called "layer" at user level).  Single and multi-category
support on modules level are implemented. The z coordinate is optional 
and both 2D and 3D files may be written.

The following <em>vector feature types (primitives)</em> are defined
by the vector library (and holds by the coor file; see also \ref
vlibFeatureTypes):

- point: a point (2D or 3D) - GV_POINT
- line: a directed sequence of connected vertices with two endpoints
  called nodes (2D or 3D) - GV_LINE
- boundary: the border line to describe an area (2D only) - GV_BOUNDARY
- centroid: a point within a closed boundary(ies) to describe an area
  (2D only) - GV_CENTROID
- face: a 3D boundary (not implemented yet) - GV_FACE
- kernel: a 3D centroid in a volume - GV_KERNEL

From vector feature types mentioned above are derived:

- area: the topological composition of a closed ring of boundary(ies)
  and optionally a centroid (2D only, 3D coordinates supported but
  ignored) - GV_AREA
- isle: an area within area, not touching the boundaries of the outer
  area (2D only, 3D coordinates supported but ignored)
- volume: a 3D corpus, the topological composition of faces and
  kernel (not implemented yet) - GV_VOLUME
- hole: a volume within volume, 3D equivalent to isle within area (not
  implemented yet)

Note that all lines and boundaries can consist of multiple segments.

Area topology also holds information about isles. <em>Isles</em> are
located within an area, not touching the boundaries of the outer
area. Isles consist of one or more areas and are used internally by
the vector library to maintain correct topology of areas.

\section vlibVectorLevels Levels of read access

There are two levels of read access to the vector data:

- <i>Level One</i> provides simple access to the vector feature
  information. There is no access to topology information at this
  level.
- <i>Level Two</i> provides full access to all the information
  including topology information. This level requires more from the
  programmer, more memory, and longer startup time. Without this level,
  areas are not available.

The level of access is retured by Vect_open_old().

<b>Example for sequential read access without topology:</b>
\code
int main
{
    int type, ltype;
    struct Map_info Map;
    struct line_pnts *Points;
    struct line_cat *Cats;
    const char *name, *mapset;

    /* set open level to 1: no topology */
    Vect_set_open_level(1);

    if (Vect_open_old(&Map, name, mapset) < 1)
	G_fatal_error(_("Failed to open vector '%s'"), name);

    /* rewind vector file */
    Vect_rewind(&Map);
    
    Points = Vect_new_line_struct();
    Cats = Vect_new_cats_struct();

    while ((ltype = Vect_read_next_line(&Map, Points, Cats) > 0) {
    
	/* check for desired type */
	if (!(ltype & type))
	    continue;

	/* process the feature */
    }

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
\endcode

<b>Example for random read access with topology:</b>
\code
int main
{
    int line, nlines, type, ltype;
    struct Map_info Map;
    struct line_pnts *Points;
    struct line_cat *Cats;
    const char *name, *mapset;

    if (Vect_open_old(&Map, name, mapset) < 2)
	G_fatal_error(_("Failed to open vector '%s'"), name);

    Points = Vect_new_line_struct();
    Cats = Vect_new_cats_struct();
    
    nlines = Vect_get_num_lines(&Map);
    for (line = 1; line <= nlines; line++) {
    
	/* check for desired type */
	if (!(Vect_get_line_type(&Map, line) & type))
	    continue;

    	Vect_read_line(&Map, points, cats, line);

	/* process the feature */
    }
    
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
\endcode


<b>Example for working with areas (requires topology):</b>
\code
int main
{
    int area, nareas;
    struct Map_info Map;
    struct line_cat *Cats;
    const char *name, *mapset;

    if (Vect_open_old(&Map, name, mapset) < 2)
	G_fatal_error(_("Failed to open vector '%s'"), name);

    Points = Vect_new_line_struct();
    Cats = Vect_new_cats_struct();
    
    nareas = Vect_get_num_areas(&Map);
    for (area = 1; area <= nareas; area++) {

	/* process the area */
	/* example: get area categories */
	if (Vect_get_area_cats(&Map, area, Cats) == -1)
	    G_message(_("No catagory available for area %d"), area);
    }
    
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
\endcode


<em>Note:</em> Higher level of access are planned, so when checking
success return codes for a particular level of access (when calling
Vect_open_old() for example), the programmer should use >= instead of
== for compatibility with future releases.

An existing vector map can be opened for reading by Vect_open_old(). 
A new vector map can be created (or open for writing) by
Vect_open_new(). Vect_open_old() attempts to open a vector map at the
highest possible level of access. It will return the number of the
level at which the map was opened. Vect_open_new() always opens at level 1
only. If you require that a vector map be opened at a lower level
(e.g. one), you can call the routine <tt>Vect_set_open_level(1)</tt>;
Vect_open_old() will then either open at level one or fail. If you
instead require the highest level access possible, you should not use
Vect_set_open_level(), but instead check the return value of
Vect_open_old() to make sure it is greater than or equal to the lowest
level at which you need access. This allows for future levels to work
without need for module change.



\section vlibCategoriesLayers Categories and Layers

<i>Note: "layer" was called "field" in earlier version.</i>

In GRASS, a "category" or "category number" is a vector feature ID
used to link geometry to attributes which are stored in one or several
(external) database table(s). This category number is stored into the
vector geometry as well as a "cat" column (integer type) in each
attribute database table. The category number is used to lookup an
attribute assigned to a vector object. At user level, category numbers
can be assigned to vector objects with the <tt>v.category</tt> command.

In order to assign multiple attributes in different tables to vector
objects, each map can hold multiple category numbers. This is achieved
by assigning more than one "layer" to the map (<tt>v.db.connect</tt>
command). The layer number determines which table to be used for
attribute queries. For example, a cadastrial vector area map can be
assigned on layer 1 to an attribute table containing landuse
descriptions which are maintained by department A while layer 2 is
assigned to an attribute table containing owner descriptions which are
maintained by department B.

Each vector feature inside a vector map has zero, one or more
&lt;layer,category&gt; tuple(s). A user can (but not must) create
attribute tables which are referenced by the layer, and rows which are
essentially referenced by the &lt;layer,category&gt; pair.

%Categories start with 1 (category '0' is allowed for OGR
layers). %Categories do not have to be continuous.

Information about categories holds \ref line_cats data structure.


\section vlibAttributes Attributes

The old GRASS 4.x 'dig_cats' files are not used any more and vectors'
attributes are stored in external database. Connection with the
database is done through drivers based on \ref dbmilib. Records in a
table are linked to vector entities by layer and category number. The
layer identifies table and the category identifies record.  I.e., for
any unique combination

\verbatim
map+mapset+layer+category
\endverbatim

there exists one unique combination

\verbatim
driver+database+table+row
\endverbatim

The general DBMI settings are defined in the '$MAPSET/VAR' text file
(maintained with <tt>db.connect</tt> command at user level).

\section vlibGeometry Vector library feature geometry

\subsection vlibFeatureTypes Feature types

Feature types are defined in include/vect_dig_defines.h, see the list bellow:

- GV_POINT
- GV_LINE
- GV_BOUNDARY
- GV_CENTROID
- GV_FACE    
- GV_KERNEL  
- GV_AREA
- GV_VOLUME

- GV_POINTS (GV_POINT | GV_CENTROID)
- GV_LINES (GV_LINE | GV_BOUNDARY)

Face and kernel are 3D equivalents of boundary and centroid, but there
is no support (yet) for 3D topology (volumes). Faces are used in a
couple of modules including NVIZ to visualize 3D buildings and other
volumetric figures.


\section vlibFunc List of vector library functions

The vector library provides the GRASS programmer with routines to
process vector data. The routines in the vector library are presented
in functional groupings, rather than in alphabetical order. The order
of presentation will, it is hoped, provide better understanding of how
the library is to be used, as well as show the interrelationships
among the various routines. Note that a good way to understand how to
use these routines is to look at the source code for GRASS modules
which use them.

Note: All routines start with one of following prefixes Vect_, V1_,
V2_ or dig_. To avoid name conficts, programmers should not create
variables or routines in their own modules which use this prefix.

The Vect_*() functions are the programmer's API for GRASS vector
programming. The programmer should use only routines with this prefix.
