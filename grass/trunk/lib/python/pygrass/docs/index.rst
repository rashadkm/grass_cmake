Welcome to PyGrass documentation!
===================================

In 2006, GRASS GIS developers started to adopt Python for the new GUI. Due
to this Python became more and more important and developers converted all
shell scripts from GRASS GIS 6 to Python for GRASS GIS 7.

``pygrass`` improves the integration between GRASS GIS and Python, making
the use of Python under GRASS more consistent with the language itself. Furthermore,
it simplifies GRASS scripting and programming and more natural for the user.

This project has been funded with support from the Google Summer of Code 2012.
