Introduction
=============

To work with ``pygrass`` you need an up-to-date version of GRASS GIS 7.
You can obtain a recent version following the information provided on the
`main Web site <http://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/>`_
of GRASS, and you can read more about compilation in the 
`GRASS GIS Wiki <http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Compile_and_Install>`_

The only action before starting to work with ``pygrass`` is to launch 
GRASS GIS 7 and from the console launch ``python`` or ``ipython`` 
(the second one is the recommended way).

Read more about how to work with ``pygrass`` in this documentation.
