<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.buffer</em> creates a buffer around features of
given <b>type</b>, which have a category in the
given <b>layer</b>. The <b>tolerance</b> controls the number of vector
segments being generated (the smaller the value, the more vector
segments are generated).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Internal buffers for areas can be generated with negative distiance 
values (GRASS must be compiled with GEOS).
<p>
Categories and attributes can be transferred with the <b>t</b> flag. 
The resulting buffer areas can have multiple categories, and multiple 
buffer areas can have the same category. The buffer for the input 
feature with category X can thus be retrieved by selecting all buffer 
areas with category X (see example below).

<p>
Buffers for lines and areas are generated using algorithm from GEOS
library. If GRASS is not compiled with GEOS support or environmental
variable <tt>GRASS_VECTOR_BUFFER</tt> is defined, then GRASS generates
buffers using built-in buffering algorithm (which is still buggy for
some input data).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

All examples are based on the North Carolina sample dataset.

<h3>Buffer around input lines</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.buffer input=roadsmajor output=roadsmajor_buffer type=line distance=100
</pre></div>

<h3>Circles around input points</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.buffer input=hospitals output=hospitals_circled type=point distance=1000 
</pre></div>

<h3>Circles around input points with attribute transfer</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.buffer input=hospitals output=hospitals_circled type=point distance=1000 -t
# display buffer around hospital with category 36,
# this buffer is composed of several areas:
d.vect map=hospitals_circled type=area layer=1 cats=36
# extract this buffer, dissolving boundaries
v.extract in=hospitals_circled out=hospital_36_circled layer=1 cats=36 -d
</pre></div>
