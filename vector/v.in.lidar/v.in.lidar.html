<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.in.lidar</em> converts LiDAR point clouds in LAS format to a GRASS 
vector, using the <a href="http://www.liblas.org">libLAS</a> library. 
The created vector is true 3D with x, y, z coordinates.
<p>
The typical file extensions for the LAS format are .las and .laz (compressed). 
The compressed LAS format can be imported only if libLAS has been compiled 
with laszip support. It is also recommended to compile libLAS with GDAL, 
needed to text for matching projections.
<P>
For larger datasets, it is recommended to not build topology (-b flag).
Also, creating a table with attributes can take some time for larger datasets.

<P>
The optional <b>spatial</b> parameter defines spatial query extents.
This parameter allows the user to restrict the region to a spatial subset
while importing the data. All LiDAR points falling into this rectangle 
subregion are imported. The <b>-r</b> current region flag is identical, 
but uses the current region settings as the spatial bounds 
(see <em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em>).

<H2>Location Creation</H2>

<em>v.in.lidar</em> attempts to preserve projection information when importing
datasets if the source format includes projection information, and if
the LAS driver supports it.  If the projection of the source dataset does
not match the projection of the current location <em>v.in.lidar</em> will 
report an error message ("<tt>Projection of dataset does not appear to 
match current location</tt>") and then report the PROJ_INFO parameters of
the source dataset.

<P>
If the user wishes to ignore the difference between the apparent coordinate
system of the source data and the current location, they may pass the 
<b>-o</b> flag to override the projection check.

<P>
If the user wishes to import the data with the full projection definition,
it is possible to have <em>v.in.lidar</em> automatically create a new location based
on the projection and extents of the file being read.  This is accomplished
by passing the name to be used for the new location via the <b>location</b>
parameter.  Upon completion of the command, a new location will have been
created (with only a PERMANENT mapset), and the vector map will have been
imported with the indicated <b>output</b> name into the PERMANENT mapset.
