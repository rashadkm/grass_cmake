these are so far just notes and polishing:

1. it writes in history file:

data source site file and should be vector file
            ^^^^                    ^^^^^^

2. change the word for parameter dmax to dmin (for people used to s.surf.tps
this gets confusing)

3. missing manual page?

4. it says ...identical points instead of
           ....point closer than given dmin (or whatever we have in s.surf.tps)

5. check whether masking works

6. the program has not been tested and may not be updated for variable smoothing
