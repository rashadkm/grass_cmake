<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>t.list</em> lists any dataset that is registered in the temporal database. 
Datasets are raster, 3D raster and vector maps as well as their 
corresponding space time datasets (STRDS, STR3DS and STVDS). The type of the dataset
can be specified using the <em>type</em> option, default is STRDS. By default all datasets with
relative and absolute time are listed. However, the user has the ability to specify
a single temporal type with the <em>temporaltype</em> option.
The user can define the columns that should 
be printed for each dataset and the order of the datasets. In addition a SQL WHERE statement can
be specified to select a subset of the requested datasets.
