<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Image segmentation or object recognition is the process of grouping 
similar pixels into unique segments, also refered to as objects. 
Boundary and region based algorithms are described in the literature, 
currently a region growing and merging algorithm is implemented. Each 
object found during the segmentation process is given a unique ID and 
is a collection of contiguous pixels meeting some criteria. Note the 
contrast with image classification where all pixels similar to each 
other are assigned to the same class and do not need to be contiguous. 
The image segmentation results can be useful on their own, or used as a 
preprocessing step for image classification. The segmentation 
preprocessing step can reduce noise and speed up the classification.

<H2>NOTES</h2>

<h3>Region Growing and Merging</h3>
This segmentation algorithm sequentially examines all current 
segments in the map. The similarity between the current segment and 
each of its neighbors is calculated according to the given distance 
formula. Segments will be merged if they meet a number of criteria, 
including: 1. The pair is mutually most similar to each other (the 
similarity distance will be smaller than to any other neighbor), and 
2. The similarity must be lower than the input threshold. The process 
is repeated until no merges are made during a complete pass.

<h3>Similarity and Threshold</h3>
The similarity between segments and unmerged objects is used to 
determine which objects are merged. Smaller distance values indicate a 
closer match, with a similarity score of zero for identical pixels.
<p>
During normal processing, merges are only allowed when the 
similarity between two segments is lower than the givem 
threshold value. During the final pass, however, if a minimum 
segment size of 2 or larger is given with the <em>minsize</em> 
parameter, segments with a smaller pixel count will be merged with 
their most similar neighbor even if the similarity is greater than 
the threshold.
<p>
The threshold should be set by the user between 0 and 1.0. A threshold 
of 0 would allow only identical valued pixels to be merged, while a 
threshold of 1 would allow everything to be merged. Initial empirical 
tests indicate threshold values of 0.01 to 0.05 are reasonable values 
to start.

<h4>Calculation Formulas</h4>
Both Euclidean and Manhattan distances use the normal definition, 
considering each raster in the image group as a dimension.

In future , the distance calculation will also take into account the 
shape characteristics of the segments. The normal distances are then
multiplied by the input radiometric weight. Next an additional 
contribution is added: (1-radioweight) * {smoothness * smoothness 
weight + compactness * (1-smoothness weight)}, where compactness = 
the Perimeter Length / sqrt( Area ) and smoothness = Perimeter 
Length / the Bounding Box. The perimeter length is estimated as the 
number of pixel sides the segment has.

<h3>Seeds</h3>
The seeds map can be used to provide either seed pixels (random or 
selected points from which to start the segmentation process) or 
seed segments (results of previous segmentations or 
classifications). The different approaches are automatically 
detected by the program: any pixels that have identical seed values 
and are contiguous will be assigned a unique segment ID.
<p>
It is expected that the <em>minsize</em> will be set to 1 if a seed 
map is used, but the program will allow other values to be used.  If 
both options are used, the final iteration that ignores the 
threshold also will ignore the seed map and force merges for all 
pixels (not just segments that have grown/merged from the seeds).

<h3>Maximum number of starting segments</h3>
For the region growing algorithm without starting seeds, each pixel 
is sequentially numbered.  The current limit with CELL storage is 2 
billion starting segment IDs.  If the initial map has a larger 
number of non-null pixels, there are two workarounds:
<p>
1.  Use starting seed pixels. (Maximum 2 billion pixels can be 
labeled with positive integers.)
<p>
2.  Use starting seed segments. (By initial classification or other 
methods.)

<h3>Boundary Constraints</h3>
Boundary constraints limit the adjacency of pixels and segments.  
Each unique value present in the <em>bounds</em> raster are 
considered as a MASK. Thus no segments in the final segmentated map 
will cross a boundary, even if their spectral data is very similar.

<h3>Minimum Segment Size</h3>
To reduce the salt and pepper affect, a <em>minsize</em> greater 
than 1 will add one additional pass to the processing. During the 
final pass, the threshold is ignored for any segments smaller then 
the set size, thus forcing very small segments to merge with their 
most similar neighbor.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
This example uses the ortho photograph included in the NC Sample 
Dataset.  Set up an imagery group:<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.group group=ortho_group input=ortho_2001_t792_1m@PERMANENT
</pre></div>

<p>Because the segmentation process is computationally expensive, 
start with a small processing area to confirm if the segmentation 
results meet your requirements.  Some manual adjustment of the 
threshold may be required. <br>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=ortho_2001_t792_1m@PERMANENT
</pre></div>

Try out a first threshold and check the results.<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.segment -w group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs threshold=0.04 \
          method=region_growing 
</pre></div>
<p></p>
From a visual inspection, it seems this results in oversegmentation.  
Increasing the threshold: <br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.segment -w group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs \
          threshold=0.1 method=region_growing
</pre></div>
<p></p>
This looks better.  There is some noise in the image, lets next force 
all segments smaller than 5 pixels to be merged into their most similar 
neighbor (even if they are less similar then required by our 
threshold):<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
i.segment -w --overwrite group=ortho_group output=ortho_segs \
          threshold=0.1 method=region_growing minsize=5
</pre></div>
<p></p>
Processing the entire ortho image with nearly 10 million pixels took about 
15 minutes.
