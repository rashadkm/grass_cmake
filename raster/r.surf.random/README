This program will produce a raster map layer of uniform deviates whose
magnitude can be expressed by the user. It is essentialy the same as
r.gauss.surf, but uses a linear random number generator instead. Both 
random number generators are taken from Press, Flannery, Teukolsky and 
Vetterling (1988) - Numerical Recipes in C.
