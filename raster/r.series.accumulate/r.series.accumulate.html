<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.series.accumulate</em> calculates (accumulated) raster value means, growing degree days (GDDs) or
Winkler indices's from several input maps.
<p>
The formula for calculating the raster value means
<div class="code"><pre>
    value = average
</pre></div>
The formula for calculating GDDs is
<div class="code"><pre>
    value = (max + min) / 2 - lower
</pre></div>
The formula for calculating the Winkler index is
<div class="code"><pre>
    value = average - lower
</pre></div>
with <em>min</em> being the minimum value, <em>max</em>
the maximum value and <em>average</em> the average value.
The <em>min</em>, <em>max</em> and <em>average</em> values
are automatically calculated from the input maps.
<p>
The <em>shift</em> and <em>scale</em> values are applied directly to the 
input values. The <em>lower</em> and <em>upper</em> maps, as well as the <em>range</em>
options are applied to constrain the accumulation. In case the <em>lower</em> and <em>upper</em>
maps are not provided the <em>limits</em> option with default values will be applied.
<p>
Any <em>min</em>, <em>max</em> and <em>average</em> values
above the <em>upper</em> values are set to <em>upper</em>, and any
<em>min</em>, <em>max</em> and <em>average</em> values below the 
<em>lower</em> values are set to <em>lower</em>, or in case of <em>mean</em>
computation to 0 (zero). Negative results are set to 0 (zero). 
<p>
If an existing map is provided with the <em>basemap</em> option, the
values of this map are added to the output, thus accumulating means, GDDs or winkler indices's.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The <em>scale</em> and <em>shift</em> parameters are used to transform 
input values with
<div class="code"><pre>
    new = old * scale + shift
</pre></div>
<p>
With the <em>-n</em> flag, any cell for which any of the 
corresponding input cells are NULL is automatically set to NULL 
(NULL propagation) and the accumulated value is not calculated.
<p>
Without the <em>-n</em> flag, all non-NULL cells are used for calculation.
<p>
If the <em>range=</em> option is given, any values which fall outside 
that range will be treated as if they were NULL. Note that the range is 
applied to the scaled and shifted input data. The <em>range</em> 
parameter can be set to <em>low,high</em> thresholds: 
values outside of this range are treated as NULL (i.e., they will be 
ignored by most aggregates, or will cause the result to be NULL if -n 
is given). The <em>low,high</em> thresholds are floating point, so use 
<em>-inf</em> or <em>inf</em> for a single threshold (e.g., 
<em>range=0,inf</em> to ignore negative values, or 
<em>range=-inf,-200.4</em> to ignore values above -200.4).
<p>
The number of input raster maps to be processed is given by the limit of the 
operating system. For example, both the hard and soft limits are 
typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. 
<tt>ulimit -n 1500</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher 
than the hard limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an 
entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          1500
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 1500 file. Be warned that more
files open need more RAM.

<p>
Use the <em>file</em> option to analyze large amount of raster maps 
without hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line 
arguments. The computation is slower than the <em>input</em> option 
method. For every sinlge row in the output map(s) all input maps are 
opened and closed. The amount of RAM will rise linear with the 
number of specified input maps. The input and file options are 
mutually exclusive. Input is a text file with a new line separated 
list of raster map names and optional weights. As separator between 
the map name and the weight the character | must be used.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Example with MODIS Land Surface Temperature, transforming values from 
Kelvin * 50 to degrees Celsius:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.series.accumulate in=MOD11A1.Day,MOD11A1.Night,MYD11A1.Day,MYD11A1.Night out=MCD11A1.GDD \
      scale=0.02 shift=-273.15 limits=10,30
</pre></div>
