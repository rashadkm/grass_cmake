@brief General events

Put here only truly general events. Once you find that your event can be
generated in more than one class, put your event here. Otherwise,
leave it in your class file. Events are expected to be grass/gis related.

General notice:
Command events are propagated to parent windows. However, they do not propagate 
beyond dialogs. Events do not propagate at all.
Command events works only with windows, not EvtHandlers, so for other objects
than windows you need to have extra parameter - guiparent - which can be used
for creating command events.
\code
mapEvent = gMapCreated(self._guiparent.GetId(), ...)
wx.PostEvent(self._guiparent, mapEvent)
\endcode

@todo naming conventions for events
