Symbols in form of PNG images enable to choose easily symbols in d.vect
and in wx.psmap dialogs. It is necessary to keep images synchronized with
symbols from ./lib/symbol/symbol/ directories.

How to create new symbol image:
----------------------------------
You can use following script (requires Inkscape), run script in symbol group
directory (e.g. ./lib/symbol/symbol/basic) within a GRASS session.

#!/bin/sh
DIR=$(basename $PWD)
PSMAP_FILE=tmp.psmap
PS_FILE=tmp.ps
PNG_OUT=png_out

rm -r $PNG_OUT
mkdir $PNG_OUT
for SYMBOL in *
do
    if [ -f $SYMBOL ]
    then
        echo "border none\npoint 50% 50%\n  symbol $DIR/$SYMBOL\n  end\nend" > $PSMAP_FILE
        ps.map input=$PSMAP_FILE output=$PS_FILE
        inkscape -f $PS_FILE --export-png=$PNG_OUT/$SYMBOL.png -D -h=30
        
        rm $PSMAP_FILE $PS_FILE
    else
        echo $SYMBOL is not regular file
    fi
done

Image should have 30x30 px to be displayed correctly in GUI dialog. If the symbol
has different width and height, you are supposed to correct it (for example
in Gimp see Image -> Canvas size). Also consider where the reference point of symbol
is placed (see e.g. offbox_ne, offbox_ns symbols).
