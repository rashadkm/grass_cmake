GS_get_cat_at_xy

diff gsdrape.c gsdrape.bak  - region clipping not working
(see cont. example in germany location testdata)
Inconsistent error - depends on view res, maybe check I3d init.
or num points returned. 
I think fixed now.

did a bunch of DIFFUSE -> AD changes for trial

shininess not working
OK - working now - will be different from SG3d due to infinite light.
