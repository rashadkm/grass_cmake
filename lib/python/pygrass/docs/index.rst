PyGRASS documentation!
===================================

``PyGRASS`` improves the integration between GRASS GIS and Python, making
the use of Python under GRASS more consistent with the language itself. Furthermore,
it simplifies GRASS scripting and programming and more natural for the user.

Background: In 2006, GRASS GIS developers started to adopt Python for the new GUI. Due
to this Python became more and more important and developers converted all
shell scripts from GRASS GIS 6 to Python for GRASS GIS 7.

To work with ``PyGRASS`` you need an up-to-date version of GRASS GIS 7.
The only action before starting to work with ``PyGRASS`` is to launch 
GRASS GIS 7 and from the console launch ``python`` or ``ipython`` 
(the second one is the recommended way)
