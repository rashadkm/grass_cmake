    This is a new version of v.to.rast.  It has the following features:

    (1) It does not use a temporary file. Results go directly to the raster map.
	It does this by making one or more passes thru the vector map,
	rasterizing only a fixed number of rows (in memory, default 512),
	writing these rows to the raster map, and then repeating for the
	next set of rows, etc;

    (2) The line drawing algorithm is better. The original version of v.to.rast
	moved each line to the nearest grid-cell center before rasterizing.
	This version more nearly reflects the actual path of the vector lines 
	through the grid cells; and

    (3) It works for lat/lon databases as well as planimetric databases.

    This version uses null values instead of zeros as the "background"
    It also rasterizes unlabeled areas using nulls instead of zeros.

Nov 1999

the cells where is the vector line have the value of line direction
(as an aspect angle 0-360) instead of just 1.
