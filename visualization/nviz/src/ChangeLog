	* map_obj.c (get_char_marker): Changed the default return value of
	"get_char_marker" so that an empty string is returned to tcl.  It
	is up to the tcl code to figure out what to do in this case.

Mon Mar 11 15:37:58 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* Gmakefile (OBJS): The "mkdspf" panel and C support is expected
	to be obsolete soon so I have removed these features from Nviz.
	See the directory ../archive for details.

Wed Mar  6 12:29:40 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* Gmakefile (TK_LIB_PATH): Made this version link to the tk4.0
	compatible version of tkGLX.  Eventually we will want to move all
	the libraries to their usual places in /usr/local.

Tue Mar  5 14:46:30 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* tkSend.c: Disabled security on tksend.  Make sure that script
	writers are aware of this option as nvwish interpreters will now
	accept any and all scripts.

Mon Mar  4 17:09:18 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* tkScale.c: Removed this file as apparently the old tk3.6 way of
	handling mouse events from C code has been removed and done in the
	usual fashion via the scale.tcl file in /usr/local/include/tk.
	
	* Gmakefile (TKGLX_INCLUDES): Start of upgrade to Tcl 7.4 and Tk
	4.0.  So far this has required mostly minor changes.  In
	particular, I have created updated versions of the tkBind and
	tkSpecial_Wait files.  Still need to update tkScale and tkSend.
	Also, none of the nviz scripts have been updated and the old tkGLX
	widget stuff is still being used with this version.

	(nvwish): Cleaned up the Gmakefile a bit using the recent GRASS
	4.2 distribution version as the template.
