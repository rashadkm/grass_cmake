Rules to migrate GRASS 5.0 modules into GRASS 5.1

While implementing GRASS 5.1 a major cleanup of GRASS modules
has to be done. The following rules shall help the programmer
to migrate a 5.0 module into the 5.1 environment.


1. Add GPL statement


2. Programming details:
   o String buffer length:
     - to be identical for all modules
   o consistent return types. Situation in 5.0:
     The majority of functions return 0 on error and 1 on success, but there
     are many which return 0 on success and a negative value on failure.
     Proposal for 5.1?


... to be extended...
