<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<!-- TODO: the use of Addon and extension is not coherent -->

<em>g.extension</em> downloads and installs, removes or updates
extensions (addons) from the official
<a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/addons/">GRASS GIS Addons repository</a>
or user-specified source
into the local GRASS GIS installation.

<h3>Managing installed extensions</h3>

<p>Re-running <em>g.extension</em> on an installed GRASS GIS Addon
extension re-installs the requested extension which may include
updates.
<p>
To bulk-update all locally installed GRASS GIS extensions, 
<em><a href="g.extension.all.html">g.extension.all</a></em> module
is available.


<h3>Where the extensions are installed</h3>

GRASS GIS extensions are installed by <em>g.extension</em> into a dedicated
directory.
The default is a directory for application data and settings inside
the user's home directory. 
On GNU/Linux it is <tt>$HOME/.grass7/addons</tt>,
on MS Windows it is <tt>$APPDATA\GRASS7\addons</tt>.
The directory is stored in <tt>GRASS_ADDON_BASE</tt> environmental variable.

<p>
The flag <b>-s</b> changes this install target directory to the GRASS GIS
installation directory
(determined by <tt>GISBASE</tt> environmental variable, e.g. <tt>/usr/</tt>)
rather than the
default GRASS_ADDON_BASE directory
(see also documentation for <a href="variables.html">variables</a>).
<em>g.extension</em> checks if the user has permission to write to
GISBASE or GRASS_ADDON_BASE.

<p>
The place where the extensions are installed can be customized by
the option <b>prefix</b>. Ensuring that these extensions will be accessible
in GRASS GIS is then responsibility of the user.


<h3>Source code sources and repositories</h3>

By default, <em>g.extension</em> installs extensions from the official
GRASS GIS Addons repository. However, different source can be specified
using the <b>url</b> option.

<p>
New extension can be also installed from a source code placed
in a local directory on disk. This is advantageous when developing
a new module.
To keep the directory clean, the directory content is copied
to a temporary directory and the compilation happens there.

<p>
New extension can be also installed from a ZIP file
or an archive file from the TAR family (e.g., <tt>.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>.bz2</tt>).
The file can be a file on disk (specified a path), which was probably downloaded
at some point, or a file on web (specified by an URL).

<p>
For well known general hosting services, namely GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket,
<em>g.extension</em> supports download of a repository as a ZIP file
when user needs to provide only a basic URL to the repository web page
(with or without the <tt>https://</tt> part).
For GitLab and Bitbucket, the latest source code in the default branch is downloaded,
for GitHub, the latest source code in the master branch is downloaded.
Of course, user can still specify full URL of a ZIP file
and install a specific branch or release in this way (ZIP file mechanism will be applied).

<p>
Individual extensions can be also installed by providing a URL to
source code on OSGeo Trac. This, however, works only for certain directories
where download of a downloads a ZIP file was enabled by project administrators.

<p>
When none of the above sources is identified, <em>g.extension</em> assumes
that the source is a Subversion repository and uses <em>svn</em> command line tool
to obtain the source code. The expected structure of the repository
should be the same as the one of the official repository.

<p>
For the official repository, <em>g.extension</em> supports listing available
extensions (addons) and few other metadata-related operations which
depend on a specific infrastructure.
For other sources and repositories, this is not supported because it is assumed
that other sources contain only one extension, typically a module or group of modules.

<p>
Non-official sources are supported on all operating systems except for MS Windows.


<h3>Compilation and installation</h3>

On MS Windows systems, where compilation tools not readily available,
<em>g.extension</em> downloads a compiled executable
from the GRASS GIS project server. On all other operating systems
where it is not difficult to install compilation tools,
<em>g.extension</em> downloads the source code of the requested
extension (addon) and compiles it locally.
This applies for both C and Python modules
as well as any other extensions. The reason is that more things such
as manual page are compiled, not only the source code (which is really
necessary to compile just in case of C).


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Download and install of an extension</h3>

Download and install <em>r.stream.distance</em> into current GRASS installation

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension extension=r.stream.distance
</pre></div>

This installs the extension from the official repository.
For convenience, a shorter syntax can be used:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension r.stream.distance
</pre></div>

<h3>Download and install of an extension when behind a proxy</h3>

Example for an open http proxy:
<div class="code"><pre>
# syntax: http://proxyurl:proxyport
g.extension extension=r.stream.distance proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
</pre></div>

<p>
Example for a proxy with proxy authentication:
<div class="code"><pre>
# syntax: http://username:password@proxyurl:proxyport
g.extension extension=r.stream.distance proxy="http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080"
</pre></div>

<h3>Managing the extensions</h3>

List all available extensions in the official GRASS GIS Addons repository:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension -l
</pre></div>

List all locally installed extensions:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension -a
</pre></div>

Removal of a locally installed extension:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension extension=r.stream.distance operation=remove
</pre></div>

<h3>Installing from various repositories online</h3>

Simple URL to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket repositories:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension r.example url=github.com/johnsmith/r.example
</pre></div>

Simple URL to OSGeo Trac (downloads a ZIP file, requires download to be enabled in Trac):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension r.example url=trac.osgeo.org/.../r.example
</pre></div>

In general, when a ZIP file or other archive is provided, the full URL can be used:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension r.example url=http://example.com/.../r.example?format=zip
</pre></div>

Note that because of MS Windows operating system architecture,
only official repository is supported on this platform.


<h3>Installing when writing a module</h3>

Having source code of a GRASS module in a directory on disk
one can install it using:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.extension r.example url=/local/directory/r.example/
</pre></div>


<h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>

Toolboxes in the official repository cannot be downloaded.
On MS Windows, only the official repository is working
because there is no way of compiling the modules
(a Python replacement for Python scripts should be implemented).
